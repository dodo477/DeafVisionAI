# Contributing to DeafVisionAI

Thanks for your interest in DeafVisionAI.

This project is a **public-good proposal**, released as an open-source blueprint to help others build ethical, AI-driven sign language accessibility tools.

I am **not actively developing** this tool, but:

âœ… You are welcome to fork, prototype, or extend it  
âœ… Attribution is appreciated but not required  
âœ… You may use this project to apply for funding, collaborate with NGOs, or build integrations  
ðŸš« Please do not position this as an official product unless your work clearly distinguishes itself

If you have suggestions, aligned research, or new branches â€” feel free to open an issue or discussion.

Let's make accessibility systemic, not just available.
