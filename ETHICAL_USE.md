# 🧭 Ethical Use Statement (Non-Binding)

**DeafVisionAI** is proposed as a public good intended to expand access, dignity, and linguistic autonomy for Deaf communities through open, non-exploitative technology.

While this project is licensed under the AGPL-3.0, which ensures legal openness, we also request that developers and institutions using or adapting this project respect the following **ethical principles**:

## ⚖️ Ethical Principles

1. **Inclusion, Not Replacement**
   - This system is not intended to replace human sign language interpreters.
   - It should be used where no interpretation is available, or to supplement access—not to displace cultural labor.

2. **Representation Matters**
   - Deaf individuals, sign language users, and culturally Deaf advisors should be consulted in development and deployment.
   - Regional dialects, racial identity, and signing styles must be respected and represented.

3. **No Closed Commercialization**
   - Do not build closed-source or proprietary systems from this work without open, shared improvements.
   - Monetization may occur only in ways that preserve public access and transparency.

4. **No Surveillance or Coercion**
   - This project may not be used for surveillance, behavioral profiling, or extracting biometric data from Deaf users.
   - It must not be deployed in authoritarian or coercive contexts without consent and oversight.

5. **Cultural Sensitivity**
   - Sign languages are not universal. Avoid treating them as interchangeable.
   - Emotional tone, rhythm, and performance style are integral to communication and must not be flattened or sanitized.

## 🤝 This Is a Civic Request, Not a Legal Clause

I understand that open projects invite adaptation.  
This is not a restrictive license or formal barrier — it is a **conscience clause** for ethical developers and institutions.  
If you benefit from this project, consider aligning with its intent:  
> **To empower Deaf people, not merely “serve” them.**
